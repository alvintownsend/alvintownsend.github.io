    * in a standard and supported way
    * more quickly
  * puts a premium on choosing technology that improves stability, support, and ease of maintenance

    + even answered the DOC while on vacation:
      * in Switzerland:
        * on Mount Pfannenstiel:
          * on a giant Aussichtsturm.
  * is always available when a problem arises, neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night

    * sometimes by providing the answer
    * sometimes by providing guidance
    * sometimes by providing neither
  * enjoys his job
  * likes bullet points
